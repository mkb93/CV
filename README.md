## Marco Karim Belahouane

I am a multi-cultural problem solver that has been kicking people in the head for over a decade. I've always lived in stressful environment and I've always found "non-violent" solutions. I believe that the technological advances within this next decade are going to take problem solving to the next level and I can't wait to be part of the solution.

## Skills

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while teaching varying size groups of individuals from 100 to just 1. I grew to understand how engagement varies in personal communication to team communication. I have found that my teaching experience has helped me to articulate ideas more directly and clearly. 

#### Adaptability

- Whilst Thai Boxing may have a very different skillset to software engineering, there seems to be a similarity in the constant changing state of the industry, every month there is a new technique or fighter that people expect you to know about and be able to comfortably use. I've been able to hone my ability to adapt to new environments and ideas by embracing the similarities and developing broader understandings of topics rather than focus on the specific differences.

#### Responsibility
- I have found myself in positions of responsibility for groups of people, not just in classes whilst coaching Thai boxing, but also while organising fights and guiding fighters through the process of training for the fight. I also consider the efforts of my fighters to be directly correlated to the effort I put in.
