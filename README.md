## Marco Karim Belahouane

I am a multi-cultural problem solver that has been kicking people in the head for over a decade. I've always lived in stressful environment and I've always found "non-violent" solutions. I believe that the technological advances within this next decade are going to take problem solving to the next level and I can't wait to be part of the solution.

## Skills

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Advertising

- I made videos and tutorials, throughout lockdown to keep my business working and to keep my customers inspired. It taught me a lot about social media and how to reach people with relevant products.

#### Social organisation
- I have found myself in positions of responsibility for groups of people not just in classes whilst coaching Thai boxing but also while organising fights and guiding fighters through the process of training for the fight.
