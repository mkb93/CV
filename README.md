## Marco Karim Belahouane

I am a multi-cultural problem solver that has been kicking people in the head for over a decade. I've always lived in stressful environment and I've always found "non-violent" solutions. I believe that the technological advances within this next decade are going to take problem solving to the next level and I can't wait to be part of the solution.
